> [!question] What is Cloud Computing?
> Using network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data and not on a local computer

### Evolution of Cloud Computing
- Dedicated server
	- one physical machine -> single business
	- pros: high security
	- cons: expensive, high maintenance
- VPS Virtual Private Server
	- one machine -> virtualized into sub-machines
	- pros: runs multiple web-apps, better utilization and isolation of resources
	- cons: 
- Shared Hosting
	- one physical machine -> shared by many businesses
	- pros: super cheap, maintainance costs are delegated
	- cons: relies on most people under-utilizing resources, limited to machines functionality, poor isolation
- Cloud Hosting
	- *multiple* physical machines -> act as one system
	- sys is abstracted into multiple cloud services
	- pros: flexible, scalable, secure, add more services as needed, virtualised isolation, shared costs so it's cheap, high configurability

### AWS - Amazon Web Services - fun facts
- launched in 2006, leading cloud service provider (CSP)
- Simple Queue Service - 2004 - first service launched for public use
- Simple Storage Service (S3) - 2006
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - 2006 - most used right now

### What is a CSP?

> [!info] What classifies as a Cloud Service Platform
> essentially a company that provides the following
> 	- multiple cloud services
> 	- chained together to create cloud architecture
> 	- unified and accessible via a **Single Unified API** - eg: AWS API
> 	- utilize metered billing based on usage
> 	- rich monitoring built in - eg: AWS CloudTrail
> 	- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
> 	- offer automation via IaC
> 

### Landscape of CSPs
- Tier 1 - Top Tier - AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud
- Tier 2 - Mid Tier - IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud
- Tier 3 - Light Tier - Vultr, Digital Ocean, Akamai (offer more core Iaas, cost-effective, mostly VPS)
- Tier 4 - Private Tier - OpenStack, Apache CloudStack, VMWare vSphere (Iaas but on your own private data center)

### Common Cloud Services - 4 Core Services
- Compute - virtual computer that runs apps, programs and code
- Networking - virtual network defining internet connections or isolations between services 
- Storage - virtual hard drive - stores files
- Databases - virtual DB - storing reporting data, db for general web app purposes

#### AWS Tech
- Compute - EC2 Virtual Machines
- Networking - VPC Private Cloud Network
- Storage - EBS Virtual Hard Drives
- Databases - RDS SQL databases
outside of the core:
	- analytics, app integration, ML, IoT, Blockchain, Media Services, Robotics, Satellites, Billing

### Types of Cloud Computing
- Saas - for customers
	- run and managed by service provider
	- Salesforce , GMail, Office365
	- designed for customers
- PaaS - platform - for devlopers
	- focus on deployment and management of your apps
	- Heroku
- IaaS - Infrastructure - for admins

### Cloud Computing Models
Public Cloud
- everything built on the CSP
- a.k.a Cloud First
Private Cloud
- built on company's datacenters
- a.k.a On-Premise
Hybrid Cloud
- both on-Premise and CSP together
Cross-Cloud/Multi-Cloud
- using multiple CSPs
- eg: using Azure Arc for GCP Kubernetes within Amazon EKS

### Deployment Model Use Cases

| Startups, small enough to go from VSP to CSP<br>SaaS offerings<br>New Projects and companies | orgs that started with own datacenter<br>can't easily move to cloud without enough resources | - orgs that cannot run on cloud due to regulatory compliance<br>- have sensitive data |
| DropBox, Basecamp, SquareSpace                                                               | Deloitte, CIBC, Fintech, Investment Management, Legacy On-Premise                            | hospitals, government, AIG                                                            |

### Regions in AWS
- reccomend using us-east-1
	- billing only shows up in us-east-1
- some services are "global" services - S3 and CloudFront (does not require region selection)
- some services have a region dependancy

### Billing
